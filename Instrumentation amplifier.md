### **INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER**

Instrumentation Amplifiers are basically used to amplify small differential signals. Instrumentation Amplifier provides the most important function of Common-Mode Rejection (CMR). It cancels out any signals that have the same potential on both the inputs. The signals that have a potential difference between the inputs get amplified.

An Instrumentation Amplifier (In-Amp) is used for low-frequency signals (≪1 MHz) to provide a large amount of Gain. It amplifies the input signal rejecting Common-Mode Noise that is present in the input signal.

### **Applications**

They are used extensively in Bio-medical applications like ECG’s and EEG’s.
Instrumentation Amplifiers are used where long-term stability is essential like Industrial applications that includes automation.
Instrumentation amplifiers are incorporated with pressure transducers in Weighing Systems to monitor various physical quantities such as weight, force, pressure, displacement and torque.
They are used in Gaming industry.
Instrumentation Amplifiers are also used in hand held batteries.

### **Advantages**

Offset voltage is minimized.
Voltage Gain is high as the configuration uses high precision resistors.
The Gain of the circuit can be varied by using specific value of resistor.
Non-linearity is very low. It is an inherent performance limitation of the device and cannot be removed by external adjustment but can only be designed by the manufacturer.
Input impedance is very high to avoid loading down the input signal source and Output impedance is very low.
Common-mode rejection is very high.

### **Disadvantage**

The biggest disadvantage of Instrumentation Amplifier is the occurrence of noise when used for long range transmission purpose

### **KEY FEATURES**

Differential gain
High common-mode rejection
High input impedance
Low output impedance
Low offset and low noise (in newer devices).
