### **INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER**

-Instrumentation Amplifiers are basically used to amplify small differential signals. Instrumentation Amplifier provides the most important function of Common-Mode Rejection (CMR). It cancels out any signals that have the same potential on both the inputs. The signals that have a potential difference between the inputs get amplified.

-An Instrumentation Amplifier (In-Amp) is used for low-frequency signals (≪1 MHz) to provide a large amount of Gain. It amplifies the input signal rejecting Common-Mode Noise that is present in the input signal.

### **Applications**

They are used extensively in Bio-medical applications like ECG’s and EEG’s.<br>
Instrumentation Amplifiers are used where long-term stability is essential like Industrial applications that includes automation.<br>
Instrumentation amplifiers are incorporated with pressure transducers in Weighing Systems to monitor various physical quantities such as weight, force, pressure, displacement and torque.<br>
They are used in Gaming industry.<br>
Instrumentation Amplifiers are also used in hand held batteries.<br>

### **Advantages**

Offset voltage is minimized.<br>
Voltage Gain is high as the configuration uses high precision resistors.<br>
The Gain of the circuit can be varied by using specific value of resistor.<br>
Non-linearity is very low. It is an inherent performance limitation of the device and cannot be removed by external adjustment but can only be designed by the manufacturer.<br>
Input impedance is very high to avoid loading down the input signal source and Output impedance is very low.<br>
Common-mode rejection is very high.<br>

### **Disadvantage**

The biggest disadvantage of Instrumentation Amplifier is the occurrence of noise when used for long range transmission purpose.<br>

### **KEY FEATURES**

Differential gain<br>
High common-mode rejection<br>
High input impedance<br>
Low output impedance<br>
Low offset and low noise (in newer devices).<br>
