### ** Monostable multivibrator using 555 timer IC **

** 1. Aim **

Generate the waveform with pulse width of 0.5ms using 555 IC

** 2. Theory **

A monostable multivibrator is a circuit that has one stable state and one temporary state. Using a 555 timer IC in monostable mode, the circuit generates a single output pulse when triggered. The pulse duration is set by an external resistor and capacitor using the formula 
T=1.1×R×C. This setup is useful for delay timers, pulse generation, and switch debouncing.
