### **CURRENT MIRROR**
**What is Current Mirror?**

A current mirror is an electronic circuit used in analog and mixed-signal applications to replicate or mirror the current flowing through one active device and produce an identical current in another device. The primary purpose of a current mirror is to maintain a consistent current in multiple parts of a circuit, ensuring that different components receive the same current for precise operation.
