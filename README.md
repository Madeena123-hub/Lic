**DC,AC and Transient Analysis of Common Source Amplifier using LTSpice**

**1.**

A Common Source (CS) Amplifier is a basic MOSFET-based amplifier where the source terminal is common to both the input and output. It is widely used for voltage amplification in analog circuits.

**In this configuration:**
The input signal is applied at the gate.
The output is taken from the drain.
The source is typically grounded or connected through a resistor.
